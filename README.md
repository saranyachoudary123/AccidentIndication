# AccidentIndication
The World Health Organization states that 1.2 million people lose their lives annually due to road traffic injuries
 More than half of the deaths caused affect the two wheelers in the form of head injuries.  
Most of the deadths are preventable by the compulsory use of helmets. Studies have shown that wearing a helmet can reduce the fatalities by 70%
Global initiatives have been taken to make helmets a high priority for public health.
Many of the awareness drives have been launched, laws have been enforced in the public interests but still we find people violating the rules and driving very casually without wearing helments and thereby risking their lives.
So here we came up with a novel project of smart helmet. 
This system is designed in such a way that the vehicle will not start unless the rider wears a helmet and passes the alcohol test, thereby also solving the problem of drunken driving.
